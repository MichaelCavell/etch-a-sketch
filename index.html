The goal of this project is to to build a browser version of something between a 
sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

When the user hovers over divs in the Etch-A-Sketch grid, the divs will change 
color leaving a pixelated trail like a pen would.

Users will be able to set the number of squares per side/pixel size for the 
Etch-A-Sketch grid select different color and shading options.

This is my second time completing this project while reviewing/practicing 
concepts learned in The Odin Project.
